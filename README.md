This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript related to the `IsEmpty` function and empty strings.  The `IsEmpty` function doesn't reliably distinguish between an uninitialized Variant and a Variant containing an empty string. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors in functions that don't explicitly check for empty strings.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle this scenario.
